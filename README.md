### Project Description
"From daily grind to daily absurdity ‚Äî in one click."

Nadakkatha Swapnam Pvt. Ltd. is the official headquarters for turning your normal life into beautiful nonsense. Inspired by the legendary Dasan & Vijayan quote(from Nadodikaatu):

"Ethra sundaramaya nadakkatha swapnam."
("What a beautiful unreal dream.")

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Life is a little too‚Ä¶ realistic.
Your daily journal entries capture events exactly as they happened ‚Äî job, angry teacher, wet shoes, winning an award ‚Äî without a single touch of dream logic.
No floating cities, no upside-down offices, no conferences on Mars.
And worst of all, these memories stick around instead of fading away like absurd dreams should.
Clearly, someone had to fix this.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
You tell us what really happened.
We twist it into a surreal dream slideshow ‚Äî skyscrapers floating in the ocean, meetings held on rollercoasters, award ceremonies in zero gravity.
We add overly dramatic music, rate the absurdity of your day, and then delete it forever.
Just like a real dream: strange, short-lived, and slightly unsettling.

Dreamy Interface 
The app greets you with a soft gradient sky, like the calm before falling asleep.
A simple text box invites you to ‚ÄúTell me about your day‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî nothing flashy, just enough to lure your reality in.
With one click on Absurdify My Day, your mundane moments are whisked away into a surreal slideshow.

Rainstorms in Reverse
Captured mid-slideshow, here the rain doesn‚Äôt fall ‚Äî it floats upward into the clouds like rebellious teardrops, leaving the streets completely dry but everyone inexplicably holding umbrellas.

What started as a rainy commute to work suddenly detoured into the impossible ‚Äî a caf√© where coffee beans are tiny, jewel-toned birds singing in chorus. Proof that caffeine and dreams mix dangerously well.

Legendary Absurdity Achieved
The dream dial hits 100% ‚Äî your day has been officially certified as pure dream magic. Reality has been thoroughly dismantled, reassembled with nonsense physics, and sprinkled with cosmic glitter. A countdown ticks away in the corner, because even perfect absurdity is fleeting.

Memory Wipe Initiated
The sirens flash in neon red ‚Äî the dream‚Äôs end is here. With surgical precision, the system purges every pixel, every laugh, every impossible detail you just lived. No backups. No mercy. Only a clean slate, leaving behind the faint ache of something wonderful you‚Äôll never quite remember.

Dream Collapse
The countdown hits zero ‚Äî and just like that, the dream implodes. Colors drain, sounds fade, and the surreal world folds back into plain reality. No rewind. No archives. Your absurd masterpiece dissolves into nothing, just as all real dreams do.
